/// Process futures one after another, providing each exclusive access to some

///
/// From a functionality perspective, a `FutureQueue` is very similar to an
/// asynchronous lock, where the lock is typically to be locked via polling and
/// the owner can then subsequently keep it for an indefinite amount of time,
/// e.g. across multiple [`poll()`](core::future::Future::poll) invocations on
/// some other [`Future`]s, until eventually releasing the lock again and waking
/// other waiters. However, this asynchronous lock scheme has the drawback that
/// it is not robust against threads "loosing interest", e.g. tasks abandoned
/// for some reason: if the execution environment happens to not poll some lock
/// owning task any further, all other waiting tasks would end up stuck for
/// forever.
///
/// A `FutureQueue` solves this problem by assuming ownership of any future
/// needing access to the protected ressource and providing that (exclusively)
/// to its [`poll()`](QueuedFuture::poll) once it becomes first in line. The
/// important point is that any [`poll()`](EnqueuedFutureSubscription::poll) on
/// an enqueued future's [associated subscriptions](EnqueuedFutureSubscription)
/// will always drive progress for any other enqueued futures ahead in line,
/// even if their original submitters ceased the polling. That way, any thread
/// polling on its enqueued future's [associated
/// subscription](EnqueuedFutureSubscription) is guaranteed that its future will
/// eventually get processed.
///
/// As the enqueued future's [`poll()`](QueuedFuture::poll) had to get extended
/// in order to provide access to the `FutureQueue` arbitrated ressource, a new
/// trait [`QueuedFuture`], otherwise resembling that of a standard Rust
/// [`Future`] is being defined. Users may enqueue implementations thereof via
/// [`FutureQueue::enqueue()`](FutureQueue::enqueue) and subsequently
/// [poll](EnqueuedFutureSubscription::poll) on the resulting
/// [`EnqueuedFutureSubscription`] to drive their respective enqueued future's
